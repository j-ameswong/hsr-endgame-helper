A Honkai Star Rail "elitist"'s (potentially) handy tool to optimize their rotations and speed tuning.

This is still a very early WIP. The plan is to write a simulation engine in Java, then create a
REST api for a react frontend.

The purpose of this project, other than to contribute to the community of my favourite gacha game,
is to pad my portfolio with full stack web development, while improving my Java skills as well as applying
good SWE practices.

### Java

- [x] Implement basic `Unit`
- [x] Barebones simulation tracking action value
- [ ] Everything else in the game :skull:

### REST api

- [ ] Not started

### React frontend

- [x] Just a bit of experimenting
- [ ] Everything
